# testModifiedApfel
Modified versions of the examples found in [vbertone/APFEL_EXAMPLES](https://github.com/vbertone/APFEL_Examples).

All references to Apfel are deleted in both Evolution.cc and StructureFunctions.cc. Furthermore both files are modified to output the name of the used LHAPDF Set and the perturbative order.

## Evolution.cc
In the file Evolution.cc an option to use Apfel++ or to only show the LHAPDF results is added. It can be changed using the constant boolean _includeApfel_.

## StructureFunctions.cc
