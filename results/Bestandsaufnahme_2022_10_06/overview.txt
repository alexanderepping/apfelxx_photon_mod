There was an error when calculating the SAL data in the last Bestandsaufnahme_2022_09_15.
This is similar to that Bestandsaufnahme_2022_09_15, but with that error corrected and a new naming scheme!

All data etc (except for InitialPDFs) here is at sqrt2 GeC unless stated otherwise!
All data was calculated on 2022.10.06.

The data with Errors was calculated using the 7-point-low-noise derivative and the errorPDFs did violate the Momentum Sum Rule

There was also an error when calculating the StructureFunctions in a previous version of this folder but it is fixed now!



XX = LO or HO

dataInitialPDFsSAL3XX.txt:
    - contains the parameters for the SAL3 input type PDF at 1.3(mc) at XX
    - config file: configMinuit_InitialPDFsSAL3XX_2022_09_15.txt
    - this and config file are just taken from Bestandsaufnahme_2022_09_15

dataInitialPDFsSAL5XX.txt:
    - contains the parameters for the SAL5 input type PDF at 1.3(mc) at XX
    - config file: configMinuit_InitialPDFsSAL5XX_2022_09_15.txt
    - this and config file are just taken from Bestandsaufnahme_2022_09_15

dataEvolvedPDFsSAL3XX.txt:
    - contains the data from the evolved InitialPDFs (SAL3, parameters calculated by Minuit) and the data from the SAL InitialPDFs and their ratio
    - both at sqrt(2)

dataEvolvedPDFsSAL5XX.txt:
    - contains the data from the evolved InitialPDFs (SAL5, parameters calculated by Minuit) and the data from the SAL InitialPDFs and their ratio
    - both at sqrt(2)
